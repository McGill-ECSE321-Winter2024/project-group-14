# ECSE 321 - Introduction to Software Engineering Project Group 14

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Sport Center Registration Application! Our goal is to develop a web application to assist a local sports center in managing its operations effectively. This application will enable the center's owner and instructors to organize various types of classes. Additionally, customers will be able to browse available classes, register for sessions, and manage their bookings through their accounts. Stay tuned as we work to deliver a solution that simplifies the management of sports center activities for all stakeholders involved.

### <br> Yue Ming Xuan <br>
Hi, I am a second-year software engineering student. I have a decent knowledge of Python, Java, C, and HTML. I am interested in exploring in depth the myth behind machine learning and AI algorithms. I will be able to contribute a lot to the domain model design, the software design and the documentation of the project.

## Testing
We have implemented a comprehensive testing suite to examine the reliability of our system
Our tests cover:
1. ***Object Creation***: We validate that objects can be successfully created and retrieved from the database for each class in our system.
2. ***Attribute Validation***: We verify that the attributes of each object are correctly stored and retrieved from the database.
3. ***Reference Integrity***: We ensure that relationships between objects (such as foreign key constraints) are properly maintained in the database.

To run the tests locally, follow these steps:
- Open the `application.properties` file located at `sportCenterRegistration/src/main/resources/` and change the value of `spring.datasource.password` to your own database password.
- Open a terminal in the `sportCenterRegistration/` directory and run `./gradlew test`
